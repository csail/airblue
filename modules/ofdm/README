Steps to generate WiFi components:

1) Copy WiFiPreambles.bsv WiFiEncoder.bsv WiFiDecoder.bsv WiFiParameters.bsv to Preambles.bsv Encoder.bsv Decoder.bsv and Parameters.bsv respectively.
2a) To compile transmitter for simulation (generate ba files): 
    make WiFiTransmitter.bi
2b) To compile transmitter for synthesis (generate verilog files):
    make mkWiFiTransmitter.v  

Notes: For generating receiver, replace "Transmitter" by "Receiver" in step 2.
       For generating WiMAX components, replace "WiFi" by "WiMAX" in both steps.
       The current design can only be compiled successfully with bluespec compiler with version equal or newer than 2006.11 (build 10150, 2006-11-11).
